# Sets up the two external inference servers needed by the audio pipeline:
#   - vLLM  → Director LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) on GPU 0, port 30000
#   - Fish Speech 1.5 → TTS server on GPU 1, port 30001
#
# Run once from the repo root on a fresh GPU cluster (Ubuntu 22, CUDA 12.x).
# These are isolated from the services .venv to avoid dependency conflicts.
#
# Lessons learned (hardcoded to prevent re-discovering):
#   - vLLM needs ninja-build (apt) + ninja (pip) for FlashInfer JIT compilation
#   - fish-speech must be v1.5.1 — v2.0 changed the DAC hidden dim (512→1024),
#     making it incompatible with the fish-speech-1.5 model weights
#   - fish-speech deps must be installed with --no-deps then individually, because
#     the full `pip install -e .[stable]` backtracks on zstandard for 30+ minutes
#     and still fails. The explicit list below is exhaustive on purpose — most of
#     those modules are imported directly by fish-speech and are NOT transitive
#     deps of each other, so a partial list fails one ModuleNotFoundError at a time
#     (kui -> numpy -> audiotools -> dac -> pytorch_lightning -> funasr -> ...)
#   - fish-speech 1.5.1 server uses --llama-checkpoint-path + --decoder-checkpoint-path
#     (not --checkpoint-path, which was removed between v1.4 and v1.5.1)
#   - the TTS client (services/tts/fish_audio.py) must POST ormsgpack to /v1/tts —
#     fish-speech's native server has no OpenAI-style /v1/audio/speech route (404)
#   - torch 2.5.1+cu121 works for fish-speech 1.5 inference despite the pyproject.toml
#     saying torch==2.8.0 — 2.8.0 isn't available for cu121
#   - AudioGen.get_pretrained() must receive device='cuda' (not 'cuda:2') because
#     audiocraft passes device_type to torch.autocast which rejects 'cuda:N' format;
#     use torch.cuda.set_device(N) + 'cuda' instead (already fixed in audiogen.py)
#   - The Director calls vLLM with model='meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct' (with
#     the .1) — must match exactly what vLLM was started with (already fixed in model.py)
