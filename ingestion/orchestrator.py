"""Two-pass, 8-way data-parallel ingestion pipeline.

Pass 1 (Global Registry):
    The book is split into large overlapping-free chunks, one chunk per LLM
    call, fanned out across all 8 GPU replicas concurrently. Each call asks
    the model "who/where appears in this text and what's their baseline
    appearance/voice?". Results are merged, deduplicated by name/alias, and
    written once to `characters` / `locations` (Tier 1).

Pass 2 (Temporal Ledger + Paragraph Beats):
    The condensed Tier 1 registry (id, name, aliases only -- not full
    descriptions, to keep the prompt small) is injected as system context.
    Paragraphs are grouped into small batches and, again, fanned out
    concurrently across all 8 GPUs to extract camera framing, dialogue,
    SFX, and any character/location state *changes* for that batch.

    LLM calls in Pass 2 run concurrently and out-of-order, but the resulting
    Tier 2 rows must be written in strict book order, because each new state
    row carries forward the unset fields of the previous state (a state row
    always holds the character/location's *full* current attributes, not a
    sparse patch -- this keeps the Tier 2 read-path in app/routers a single
    "take the latest row" lookup with no further backfill needed). So Pass 2
    is split into a `generate` stage (parallel) and an `apply` stage
    (strictly sequential, in-memory, then flushed to Postgres).
