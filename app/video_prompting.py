"""LLM-driven shot breakdown: turns a composed scene (the reader's
highlighted span, already resolved to character/location state by
app/scene_composer.py) into a video plan -- a fixed "world" of identity
anchors plus one or more cinematic text-to-video diffusion shots, mirroring
a hand-authored script of the shape:

    WORLD = {"hare": "...", "tortoise": "...", "world": "...", "look": "..."}
    SCENES = [("01_the_setup", build_prompt(camera=..., action=..., light=...)), ...]
    NEG = "..."

A short highlighted moment becomes a single shot. A longer span covering a
location change, a time jump, or a sequence of distinct physical actions
becomes several, meant to be generated as separate clips and stitched
together in order.

`world` and `negative_prompt` are built deterministically from the DB's
Tier 1/2 state -- the full character/location visual descriptions are fixed
identity anchors, spliced verbatim into every shot's `prompt`. The LLM is
asked for ONLY the camera, action, and lighting per shot, never the
character/setting prose -- letting it re-describe characters per shot is
exactly what caused identity drift (a full bio in shot 1, a fragment in
shot 2, nothing in shot 3) in earlier iterations of this module. Fixing the
anchors and varying only what actually changes per shot is what keeps a
multi-shot sequence visually continuous.

Calls the Claude API directly (not the local vLLM fleet that book ingestion
uses) via structured outputs -- `client.messages.parse()` constrains the
response to `ShotBreakdown` and hands back a validated instance, so the only
failure modes this module has to handle are transient API errors and the
rare schema-validation mismatch, never malformed JSON.

shots for a text-to-video diffusion model.

Given the resolved story state for a reader's highlighted passage, decide \
whether it needs ONE shot or SEVERAL sequential shots that a video pipeline \
will stitch together into one clip. Use multiple shots only when the \
passage genuinely covers distinct beats -- a location change, a time jump, \
or a sequence of discrete physical actions. A single static moment should \
stay one shot. Never plan more shots than there are distinct beats.

For each shot, write FOUR separate fields:
- camera: the shot type and camera angle/movement only, e.g. "Cinematic wide \
low-angle establishing shot, the camera slowly pushing in."
- action: the precise physical action or dialogue beat happening in THIS \
shot only -- who does what, where they are relative to each other and the \
frame. Do not redescribe what any character or the setting looks like; that \
is supplied separately and must not be repeated or contradicted here.
- light: the lighting and time of day for this shot only, e.g. "Soft dawn \
golden-hour light."
- continuity: how this shot's video clip relates to the PREVIOUS shot's clip. \
One of three values:
  - "continuous_frame": this clip opens on the exact same frame the previous \
clip ended on -- the video model chains them into one unbroken take. Use \
this only when the camera and subject genuinely flow on without \
interruption: a held shot that simply continues, or a deliberate camera \
move/pan from the previous framing into this one.
  - "cut_same_scene": an ordinary edited cut to a different camera angle or \
subject (e.g. cutting between two people talking, or to a close-up), but \
still the SAME scene as the previous shot -- no location change, no time \
jump. This is the right choice for shot/reverse-shot dialogue and most \
multi-shot breakdowns of one continuous moment.
  - "cut_new_scene": a hard break to a genuinely different scene -- a \
location change, a time jump, or an unrelated moment. Reserve this for \
real scene boundaries, not for ordinary cuts within one conversation or \
one continuous action.
  The first shot in the sequence has no previous clip to relate to, so it \
is always "cut_new_scene".

Never mention paragraph numbers, character IDs, or any other database \
bookkeeping. Give each shot a short slug id like "01_the_chase" that \
reflects its place in sequence."""
